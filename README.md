This is a tool target at `.so` file repair, which section header has been damaged.

Temporarily support 32bits-so-file.

## About this project

To rebuild the section header. I learning a way to rebuild by the information of `segment` and `.dynamic` section from ThomasKing's article https://bbs.pediy.com/thread-192874.htm .

Some reference articles I have placed in directory `reference` .

And my ideas and some basing knowledge have placed in directory `thinking` .

Some damaged so-file placed at `test` using for program testing.
